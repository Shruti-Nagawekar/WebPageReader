# Webpage Reader Extension

## Overview

**Webpage Reader** is a Chrome extension that reads aloud all the text on a webpage at a user-defined speed. By integrating with the browser, it provides a seamless way to convert text to speech, making it easier for users to consume written content without having to read it themselves.

## Features

- **Adjustable Speed**: Users can control the reading speed to enhance their comprehension and focus.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Utilizes the Web Speech API to read text aloud.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use controls for a better user experience.

## Why I Built This

I built this extension because I have trouble concentrating when reading. However, if the text is read at **2x speed**, it helps my focus tremendously when reading and learning something. Hence, I created this tool to improve my understanding and grasp of web content by allowing me to listen to it being read aloud at an optimal speed for better comprehension and retention.
